Interfaces and Abstract Classes Module
========================================

This module defines the core interfaces and abstract classes used across the project, specifying the expected behavior and responsibilities 
of the system's main components by providing standardized contracts. 

Interfaces and abstract classes decouple concrete implementations from their usage, promoting modularity and allowing components to be replaced transparently.
