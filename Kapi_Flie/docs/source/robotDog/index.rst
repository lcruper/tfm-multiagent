Robot Dog Package
=================

This package contains the implementation of the simulated robot dog used
during the inspection phase of the system. The robot dog follows a predefined
set of two-dimensional waypoints, moving at a constant linear speed and
notifying the system when it reaches each waypoint or finishes its path.
