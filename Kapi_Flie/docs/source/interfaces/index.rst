Interfaces Module
===================

This module defines the core abstract interfaces used across the project, specifying the expected behavior and responsibilities 
of the system's main components by providing standardized contracts. 

Interfaces decouple concrete implementations from their usage, promoting modularity and allowing components to be replaced transparently.
